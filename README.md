#Bowling
This is a bowling calculator. It can calculate bowling scores. That's
all it does for now. 

I will be turning this into a rails application and add a web interface
for it.

I hope to turn this into a bowling game app that will be playable on a
desktop.

Once I've achieved that, I will work on builing a mobile version of it
for the iPhone using Objective-C. 

Quite the ambitious project, no?
